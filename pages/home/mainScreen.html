        <h1>
            Hello!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Welcome, to my website. <br>
            I am Megalodon, a junior developer that loves making mods/codes snippets that are dedicated for Starblast.io.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website, is a storage place where you will be able to find most of the codes I made.
            I constantly update it, with new codes and mods of my making.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Where are the codes ?
        </h3>
        <p>
            I made the website to be kinda intuitive.. <br>
            On the LEFT you will find all of the categories. <br>
            Once you click on one, you will be redirected to a new page where you will find a list of the mods that are part of the chosen category.
        </p>
        <p>
            On one card you will find 3 buttons, one of them will be your best friend, the Guide button. <br>
            Once you click on it, it will drop down a little manual on how to use the mod/code snippet.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How to host a starblast mod?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Before we start, you must have a working ECP to host a modded/private game in Starblast. <br>
            If you don’t own one, you won’t be able to host a Starblast modded/private game, or you can buy one via the starblast website directly (note: the steam app doesn't come with an ECP key anymore, therefore you won't be able to host/code modded games).
        </p>
        <p>
            To start, you shall open a new Starblast modding tab on your favorite web browser. <br>
            Before pasting the mod into the code section, make sure it's empty.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have cleared the code part, paste your favorite mod in.
        </p>
        <p class="blue">
            Press start and enjoy !
        </p>
        <h4>
            Modding must know:
        </h4>
        <p>
            You can change the region of hosting using the following command:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            Region Europe
        </div>
        <p>
            With 3 possible regions: Europe | Amercia | Asia.
        </p>
